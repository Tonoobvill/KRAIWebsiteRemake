            <p class="sub-header">What is the P.E.R.T.?</p>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The Postsecondary Education Readiness Test (P.E.R.T.) is Florida's new common placement
                    test. This test is used by all 28 Florida colleges to determine whether or not a student is ready
                    for
                    college credit courses in math and English. The P.E.R.T. has been aligned with the
                    Postsecondary Readiness Competencies that Florida's faculty have identified as necessary for
                    success in entry-level college credit coursework. The test vendor, McCann Associates, has
                    worked collaboratively with the Florida Department of Education's Division of Florida Colleges
                    and Florida College System faculty to develop and tailor items to faculty specifications. P.E.R.T.
                    is comprised of three 25-item, computer adaptive subtests in reading, writing and mathematics.
                    Florida College System institutions began administering the P.E.R.T. in October 2010.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The P.E.R.T. assesses readiness for college-level coursework in English and mathematics. There
                    are three subject area tests - reading, writing, and mathematics. A student's scores determine
                    appropriate course placement upon entering college.</p>

            <p class="sub-header">What are the Postsecondary Readiness Competencies?
            </p>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The Postsecondary Readiness Competencies (PRCs) are skills identified by high school, college
                    and state university faculty as critical to college readiness in mathematics, reading and writing.
                    Entry-level college credit courses are Intermediate Algebra (MAT 1033) and Freshman
                    Composition I (ENC 1101). The PRCs for reading, writing and mathematics may be accessed on
                    the Division of Florida Colleges College and Career Readiness website at
                    <a target="_blank"

                    The PRCs are comprised of a subset of the
                    Common Core College and Career Readiness Standards, Basic Skills Exit competencies, and
                    American Diploma Project Benchmarks.

            <p class="sub-header">How many questions are on the P.E.R.T.?
            </p>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>There are a total of 30 questions per placement subtest. There are 25 operational items that will
                    be the basis of the student's placement score and 5 field test items which are designed to
                    continuously enhance the operational test bank. The student will not know which items are
                    operational so it is imperative that they try their best on all 30 items.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="sub-header">How long will it take to administer the assessment?
            </p>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The P.E.R.T. assessment is a computer adaptive test (C.A.T.) and is untimed. The average time
                    to complete the mathematics and writing subtests is approximately 30 minutes. The reading test
                    average is one hour.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="sub-header">What is a computer adaptive test?
            </p>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The goal of a computer adaptive test (C.A.T.) is to increase the accuracy of the estimate of a
                    student's ability while at the same time minimizing the number of items presented to the student.
                    In more traditional testing situations, all students respond to the same questions. Questions may
                    be too easy or too difficult for a particular student, yet the student must wade through all of the
                    items on the test to get a score. C.A.T. eliminates this issue by starting with an average ability
                    item and then, based on the student's response, subsequent items are selected to be near the
                    student's ability level. The P.E.R.T. is a competency-based C.A.T. meaning the adaptive nature
                    of the test is at the competency level, and item difficulty adjusts on the basis of responses to
                    items aligned with particular competencies.</p>
